TechCorridor.io is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of our membership in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for TechCorridor.io.

Members violating these rules may be asked to leave our chat room or meetups at the sole discretion of the TechCorridor.io administrators.  If you feel that a member is violating these rules, please contact the administrators in the [#admin Slack channel](http://techcorridor.io/slackin).

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly organization for all.
