This is a quick guide to the TechCorridor.io Slack.  We currently have 362 members, so some guidelines are helpful!
  
  * `#announcements`:  Slack doesn't allow members to leave this main channel, and it generally shouldn't have idle chitchat.  Example uses: announcing a meetup and some brief discussion, introducing new members, routing people to the right channels, and news that applies to everyone.
  * `#chitchat`:  Anything is welcome, as long as it follows our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.html)
  * `#programming`: General programming discussion.  Git, text editors, FP, OOP, exception handling, stuff like that.
  * `#jobs`: Tech job postings in the Corridor.  (Listings in this channel should be limited to jobs that are local to the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids area, or remote-friendly jobs.)  You're welcome to post here if you're looking for work, as well.  A best practice is to use direct messages to continue the conversation.

## Best Practices

  * Please avoid use of `@channel` and `@here`, especially in `#announcements`.  Also, please note that these notifications can be disabled if you find them distracting (especially during the workday).
  * Generally, `@channel` and `@here` should only be used for time-sensitive messages in specific channels that they affect.

Thanks for helping us scale up this Slack!  Please continue to share [techcorridor.io/slackin](http://techcorridor.io/slackin) with your friends.  Here's to the next 362 members. :)
