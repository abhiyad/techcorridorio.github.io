This is a quick guide to the TechCorridor.io Slack.  We are quickly approaching 300 members, so some guidelines are helpful!

  * #announcements:  Slack doesn't allow members to leave this main channel, and it generally shouldn't have idle chitchat.  Example uses: announcing a meetup and some brief discussion, introducing new members, routing people to the right channels, and news that applies to everyone.
  * #chitchat:  Anything is welcome, as long as it follows our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.html)
  * #programming: General programming discussion.  Git, text editors, FP, OOP, exception handling, stuff like that.
  * #jobs: Tech job postings in the Corridor.  You're welcome to post here if you're looking for work, as well.  A best practice is to use direct messages to continue the conversation.

Thanks for helping us scale up this Slack!  Please continue to share [techcorridor.io/slackin](http://techcorridor.io/slackin) with your friends.  Here's to the next 300 members. :)
